    The iPhone 12 costs more than its predecessors but has a crisp new HDR OLED screen. It offers nearly all the feaures of the iPhone 12 Pro, minus some camera capabilities, but should be a good enough package for most users. Apple has returned to a flat aluminium frame but the iPhone 12 promises to be more durable thanks to its Ceramic Shield material on the front and IP68 rating. 

You get the A14 Bionic SoC which makes everyday use extremely smooth and responsive, but the device does get a bit warm when stressed. Battery life is good, but not great, and you'll be able to get through a full day. The iPhone 12 is relatively light and easy to handle. iOS 14 has some new customisation options and privacy features.

You get two rear cameras - a wide-angle and an ultra-wide-angle one, which both have 12-megapixel sensors. Night mode now works across all cameras including the front one, and still shots as well as videos are remarkably sharp and detailed in the daytime as well as at night.
