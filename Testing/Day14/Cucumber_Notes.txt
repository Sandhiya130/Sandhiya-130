TDD  & BDD with cucumber:
1.setup cucumber eclipse plugin
--->go to eclips market place type cucumber
--->install cucumber eclipse plugin
--->create maven project
--->download cucumber jvm-java dependency
---->download from maven repository
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/info.cukes/cucumber-java -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>info.cukes</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-java</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.6</version>
    <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
--->install cucumber jvm-junit dependency
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/info.cukes/cucumber-junit -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>info.cukes</groupId>
    <artifactId>cucumber-junit</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.6</version>
    <type>pom</type>
    </dependency>

--->install junit dependency
<!-- https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/junit/junit -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>junit</groupId>
    <artifactId>junit</artifactId>
    <version>4.13</version>
    </dependency>
--->src/test/java--->click new file--->filename.feature
--->feature file will be created with BDD template
ex:
Feature:User Login
User should be able to login using valid credentials

Scenaio: Testing login with valid credentials
Given I am on login page
When I enter username as "robert" and password as "robert"
And I submit login page
Then I will redirect to user home page
--->now create new class[runner] by selecting src/java/test folder
--->execute logintest.feature file
--->copy output feature file and put in the new java class
--->create new java class step defination and paste the output of feature file
--->come to testrunner add and glue in @cucumberoperation line of code





--->now run the test runner 
--->in the console you will get a code 
--->copy the code and create one more java class
--->class name is stepdefination and paste the code

--->next we need to bind/combine test runner and step defination






2.Maven Dependencies
3.Feature Files
4.Scenarios
5.keywords-Given,when,Then,and,but
6.Generate step definations
7.Parametizing test
8.Data driven test using cucumber

1.intro to TDD & BDD
what is TDD:[test driven development]
writing test-->code-->run test-->all pass-->refactoring-->release
--->this is demand on agile
--->agile is short release

what is BDD:[
requirements:
testing req--->testing percs
business reg--.business
user req-->

Testing:
1.Test Scenarios---->situation/possible ways
usecase--->testcase

BDD--->framework

2.Testcase


Business requirement
Features-->Scenario(testcase)
this is mostly needed for user acceptance testing
it is also works in system testing.

Cucumber:
--->it is a tool to support BDD.
--->it gives a framework to write business feeature scenarios.
selenium--->its job is automate the browser
testng--->its a job for performing testing/comparing expeted and actual.
cucumber--->its a job of creating business requirement framework.

understanding cucumber templates:
1.Feature file
2.scenario
3.Test Runner
4.Step generator
