It looks simple when we just have one, two, or maybe five scenarios
in a feature file. However, in real life it does not happen.
For each feature under test, we may have 10, 20, or may be
more number of scenarios in a single feature file.
They may represent different purpose (Smoke test/Regression test),
different prospectives (Developer/QA/BA), different 
status (Ready for execution/Work in progress), etc. 
How to manage execution for such a mass?

For this, Cucumber has already provided a way to organize 
your scenario execution by using tags in feature file.
We can define each scenario with a useful tag. Later,
in the runner file, we can decide which specific 
tag (and so as the scenario(s)) we want Cucumber to execute.
Tag starts with “@”. After “@” you can have any relevant text
to define your tag. Let’s understand this with an example.
