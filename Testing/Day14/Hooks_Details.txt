More often we use two types of hooks:
“Before” hook and “After” hook. 
Method/function/piece of code, defined within Before
and After hooks, always run, even if the scenario gets passed or failed.

As the name suggests, 
before hook gets executed well before any other 
test scenarios, and after hook gets executed after 
executing all the scenarios.
